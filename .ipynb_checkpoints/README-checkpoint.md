## Project Goals
Become familiar with the process of creating prediction models and use various methods to evaluate them.

## Process
View the included tables and create news from them, including more relevant information for feature creation.
Perform EDA through questions and gain insights to valuable features.
Create MVP and preliminary predictive model.
Refine features and compare models.
Create Visuals on insights and continue testing models.
Clean up files and prepare presentation on findings.

## Results


## Future Goals
Continue experimenting with features until the results from the models resemble usable information.
Try more models, and experiment with binary classification.
